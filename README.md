# proj-WiemeJarne
In this project, I have developed an application that utilizes the CheapShark API to gather information on games. I chose this particular API as it contains comprehensive data regarding game sales across various stores. Additionally, the API allows users to set alerts for when a game reaches a specific price or drops below it, triggering an email notification. 
To switch between the API and local files go to the MainViewModel.cs file (this file is located in the ViewModel folder) then change the UseAPI property to true to use the API or to false to use local files.
